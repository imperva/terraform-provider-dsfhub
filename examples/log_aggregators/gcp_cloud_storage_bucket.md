	# parent_asset_id = var.parent_asset_id	# The name of an asset that this asset is part of (/related to). E.g. an AWS resource will generally have an AWS account asset as its parent. Also used to connect some log aggregating asset with the sources of their logs. E.g. An AWS LOG GROUP asset can have an AWS RDS as its parent, indicating that that is the log group for that RDS.
	# region = var.region	# For cloud systems with regions, the default region or region used with this asset
