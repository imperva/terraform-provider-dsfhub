# dsfhub_data_source (Resource)

Provides a dsfhub_data_source resource for AWS DYNAMODB.

## Example usage:

```hcl
# ### DSF Provider ###
provider "dsfhub" {
	dsfhub_token = var.dsfhub_token # TF_VAR_dsfhub_token env variable
	dsfhub_host = var.dsfhub_host # TF_VAR_dsfhub_host env variable
	#insecure_ssl = false
}

# ### Resource example for AWS DYNAMODB ###
resource "dsfhub_data_source" "example_aws_dynamodb" {
	server_type = "AWS DYNAMODB"
	# ### required ### 
	admin_email = var.admin_email	# The email address to notify about this asset
	asset_display_name = var.asset_display_name	# User-friendly name of the asset, defined by user.
	asset_id = var.asset_id	# Asset ID
	gateway_id = var.gateway_id	# Gateway ID
	region = var.region	# AWS region

	# ### optional ### 
	# application = var.application	# The Asset ID of the application asset that \"owns\" the asset.
	# asset_source = var.asset_source	# The source platform/vendor/system of the asset data. Usually the service responsible for creating that asset document
	# audit_info = var.audit_info	# Normally auto-populated when enabling the audit policy, it is a sub-document in JSON format containing configuration information for audit management. See documentation for values that can be added manually depending on asset type. Editing this value does NOT enable the audit policy.
	# audit_pull_enabled = var.audit_pull_enabled	# If true, sonargateway will collect the audit logs for this system if it can.
	# audit_type = var.audit_type # Example Values: "LOG_GROUP"	# Used to indicate what mechanism should be used to fetch logs on systems supporting multiple ways to get logs, see asset specific documentation for details
	# available_regions = var.available_regions	# A list of regions to use in discovery actions that iterate through region
	# aws_proxy_config = var.aws_proxy_config	# AWS specific proxy configuration
	# credentials_endpoint = var.credentials_endpoint	# A specific sts endpoint to use
	# criticality = var.criticality # Example Values: "1", "2", "3", "4"	# The asset's importance to the business. These values are measured on a scale from \"Most critical\" (1) to \"Least critical\" (4). Allowed values: 1, 2, 3, 4
	# database_name = var.database_name	# Specifies the name of the database (or default DB) to connect to.
	# db_engine = var.db_engine	# Specifies the version of the engine being used by the database (e.g. oracle-ee, oracle-se, oracle-se1, oracle-se2)
	# enable_audit_management = var.enable_audit_management	# If true, Sonar is responsible for setting and updating the policies
	# enable_audit_monitoring = var.enable_audit_monitoring	# If true, Sonar sends emails/alerts when the audit policies change.
	# entitlement_enabled = var.entitlement_enabled	# If true, Entitlement Management system is enabled.
	# gateway_service = var.gateway_service	# The name of the gateway pull service (if any) used to retrieve logs for this source. Usually set by the connect gateway playbook.
	# jsonar_uid = var.jsonar_uid	# Unique identifier (UID) attached to the Sonar machine controlling the asset
	# location = var.location	# Current human-readable description of the physical location of the asset, or region.
	# logs_destination_asset_id = var.logs_destination_asset_id	# The asset name of the log aggregator that stores this asset's logs.
	# managed_by = var.managed_by	# Email of the person who maintains the asset; can be different from the owner specified in the owned_by field. Defaults to admin_email.
	# max_concurrent_conn = var.max_concurrent_conn	# Maximum number of concurrent connections that sensitive data management should use at once.
	# owned_by = var.owned_by	# Email of Owner / person responsible for the asset; can be different from the person in the managed_by field. Defaults to admin_email.
	# parent_asset_id = var.parent_asset_id	# The name of an asset that this asset is part of (/related to). E.g. an AWS resource will generally have an AWS account asset as its parent. Also used to connect some log aggregating asset with the sources of their logs. E.g. An AWS LOG GROUP asset can have an AWS RDS as its parent, indicating that that is the log group for that RDS.
	# proxy = var.proxy	# Proxy to use for AWS calls if aws_proxy_config is populated the proxy field will get populated from the http value there
	# sdm_enabled = var.sdm_enabled	# Sensitive data management (SDM) is enabled if this parameter is set to True.
	# server_port = "443"	# 
	# service_endpoints = var.service_endpoints	# Specify particular endpoints for a given service in the form of <service name>: \"endpoint\"
	# used_for = var.used_for # Example Values: "Production", "Test", "Development", "Demonstration", "QA", "Staging", "Training", "Disaster Recovery"	# Designates how this asset is used / the environment that the asset is supporting.
