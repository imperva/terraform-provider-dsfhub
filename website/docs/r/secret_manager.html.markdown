# dsfhub_secret_manager (Resource)

Provides a secret manager resource.  A secret manager is a service used to store configuration information such as 
database passwords, API keys, or TLS certificates needed by an application at runtime.

The `dsfhub_secret_manager` resource contains the configuration parameters necessary to onboard a secret manager.  
When configuring connections for assets (including data sources, cloud accounts, log aggregators and secret managers) 
in the DSF HUB, you have the option of using a secret manager as the source for fields such as user credentials or 
other secrets. If you use this option, certain configuration fields for a connection can be populated from an onboarded 
secret manager rather than from the configured fields in the asset itself.  Documentation for the underlying API used in 
this resource can be found at [Secret Managers API Definition page](https://docs.imperva.com/bundle/v4.13-sonar-user-guide/page/84552.htm).

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "dsfhub_secret_manager" "example_hashicorp" {
  server_type = "HASHICORP"
  admin_email = var.admin_email	# The email address to notify about this asset
  asset_display_name = var.asset_display_name	# User-friendly name of the asset, defined by user.
  asset_id = var.asset_id	# Asset ID
  gateway_id = var.gateway_id	# Gateway ID
  server_host_name = var.server_host_name	# Hostname (or IP if name is unknown)
  server_ip = var.server_ip	# IP address of the service where this asset is located. If no IP is available populate this field with other information that would identify the system e.g. hostname or AWS ARN, etc.
  server_port = var.server_port	# Port used by the source server
  asset_connection {
    auth_mechanism = "iam_role"
    access_id = "your_access_ID"
    aws_iam_server_id = "vault.example.com"
    reason = "default" # Used to differentiate connections if multiple connections exist for this asset"
    role_name = "your_role_name"
    secret_key = "your-secret-key-name-here"
  }
}
```
