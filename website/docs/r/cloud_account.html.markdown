# dsfhub_cloud_account (Resource)

Provides a cloud account resource.

The `dsf_cloud_account` resource contains the configuration parameters necessary to access [Cloud Accounts](https://docs.imperva.com/bundle/v4.13-sonar-user-guide/page/80357.htm) 
(AWS, GCP, Azure, etc), from the Unified Settings Console in the DSF HUB platform. 
Documentation for the underlying API used in this resource can be found at
[Cloud Account API Definition page](https://docs.imperva.com/bundle/v4.13-sonar-user-guide/page/84552.htm).

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "dsfhub_cloud_account" "example_aws_cloud_account" {
  server_type = "AWS"
  admin_email = "your@email.com"
  asset_display_name = "arn:partition:service:region:account-id" # User-friendly name of the asset
  asset_id = "arn:partition:service:region:account-id" # Also populates arn field for aws
  gateway_id = "12345-abcde-12345-abcde-12345-abcde"
  asset_connection {
    auth_mechanism = "iam_role"
    reason = "default"
    region = "us-east-1"
  }
}
```
