# dsfhub_log_aggregator (Resource)

Provides a dsfhub_log_aggregator resource for AWS LOG GROUP.

## Example usage:

```hcl
# ### DSF Provider ###
provider "dsfhub" {
	dsfhub_token = var.dsfhub_token # TF_VAR_dsfhub_token env variable
	dsfhub_host = var.dsfhub_host # TF_VAR_dsfhub_host env variable
	#insecure_ssl = false
}

# ### Resource example for AWS LOG GROUPresource "dsfhub_log_aggregator" "example_aws_log_group" {
	server_type = "AWS LOG GROUP"
	# ### required ### 
	admin_email = var.admin_email	# The email address to notify about this asset
	arn = var.arn	# Amazon Resource Name - format is arn:partition:service:region:account-id and used as the asset_id
	asset_display_name = var.asset_display_name	# User-friendly name of the asset, defined by user.
	asset_id = var.asset_id	# Asset ID
	gateway_id = var.gateway_id	# Gateway ID
	parent_asset_id = var.parent_asset_id	# Amazon Resource Name of the account asset that contains this asset

	# ### optional ### 
	# application = var.application	# The Asset ID of the application asset that \"owns\" the asset.
	# asset_source = var.asset_source	# The source platform/vendor/system of the asset data. Usually the service responsible for creating that asset document
	# audit_info = var.audit_info	# Normally auto-populated when enabling the audit policy, it is a sub-document in JSON format containing configuration information for audit management. See documentation for values that can be added manually depending on asset type. Editing this value does NOT enable the audit policy.
	# audit_pull_enabled = var.audit_pull_enabled	# If true, sonargateway will collect the audit logs for this system if it can.
	# audit_type = var.audit_type # Example Values: "LOG_GROUP", "AGGREGATED", "SERVICE", "SERVICE_4"	# Used to indicate what mechanism should be used to fetch logs on systems supporting multiple ways to get logs, see asset specific documentation for details
	# aws_proxy_config = var.aws_proxy_config	# AWS specific proxy configuration
	# ca_certs_path = var.ca_certs_path	# Certificate authority certificates path; what location should the sysetm look for certificate information from. Equivalent to --capath in a curl call
	# ca_file = var.ca_file	# Path to a certificate authority file to use with the call. Equivalent to --cacert in a curl call
	# content_type = var.content_type	# Content type should be set to the desired <'parent' asset 'Server Type'>, which is the one that uses this asset as a destination for logs. NOTE: The content_type field will take precedence on the lookup for parent_asset_id field when checking which server is sending logs to this asset.
	# credentials_endpoint = var.credentials_endpoint	# A specific sts endpoint to use
	# criticality = var.criticality # Example Values: "1", "2", "3", "4"	# The asset's importance to the business. These values are measured on a scale from \"Most critical\" (1) to \"Least critical\" (4). Allowed values: 1, 2, 3, 4
	# database_name = var.database_name	# Specifies the name of the database (or default DB) to connect to.
	# db_engine = var.db_engine	# Specifies the version of the engine being used by the database (e.g. oracle-ee, oracle-se, oracle-se1, oracle-se2)
	# enable_audit_management = var.enable_audit_management	# If true, Sonar is responsible for setting and updating the policies
	# enable_audit_monitoring = var.enable_audit_monitoring	# If true, Sonar sends emails/alerts when the audit policies change.
	# entitlement_enabled = var.entitlement_enabled	# If true, Entitlement Management system is enabled.
	# gateway_service = var.gateway_service	# The name of the gateway pull service (if any) used to retrieve logs for this source. Usually set by the connect gateway playbook.
	# jsonar_uid = var.jsonar_uid	# Unique identifier (UID) attached to the Sonar machine controlling the asset
	# location = var.location	# Current human-readable description of the physical location of the asset, or region.
	# managed_by = var.managed_by	# Email of the person who maintains the asset; can be different from the owner specified in the owned_by field. Defaults to admin_email.
	# max_concurrent_conn = var.max_concurrent_conn	# Maximum number of concurrent connections that sensitive data management should use at once.
	# owned_by = var.owned_by	# Email of Owner / person responsible for the asset; can be different from the person in the managed_by field. Defaults to admin_email.
	# proxy = var.proxy	# 
	# sdm_enabled = var.sdm_enabled	# Sensitive data management (SDM) is enabled if this parameter is set to True.
	# service_endpoint = var.service_endpoint	# Specify a particular endpoint for a given service
	# ssl = var.ssl	# 
	# used_for = var.used_for # Example Values: "Production", "Test", "Development", "Demonstration", "QA", "Staging", "Training", "Disaster Recovery"	# Designates how this asset is used / the environment that the asset is supporting.
	# version = var.version	# Denotes the version of the asset
