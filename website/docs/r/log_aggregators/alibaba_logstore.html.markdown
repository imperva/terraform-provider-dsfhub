# dsfhub_log_aggregator (Resource)

Provides a dsfhub_log_aggregator resource for ALIBABA LOGSTORE.

## Example usage:

```hcl
# ### DSF Provider ###
provider "dsfhub" {
	dsfhub_token = var.dsfhub_token # TF_VAR_dsfhub_token env variable
	dsfhub_host = var.dsfhub_host # TF_VAR_dsfhub_host env variable
	#insecure_ssl = false
}

# ### Resource example for ALIBABA LOGSTORE ###
resource "dsfhub_log_aggregator" "example_alibaba_logstore" {
	server_type = "ALIBABA LOGSTORE"
	# ### required ### 
	admin_email = var.admin_email	# The email address to notify about this asset
	asset_display_name = var.asset_display_name	# User-friendly name of the asset, defined by user.
	asset_id = var.asset_id	# Asset ID
	endpoint = var.endpoint	# Logstore's endpoint
	gateway_id = var.gateway_id	# Gateway ID
	logstore = var.logstore	# Unit that is used to collect, store and query logs
	parent_asset_id = var.parent_asset_id	# The name of an asset that this asset is part of (/related to). E.g. an AWS resource will generally have an AWS account asset as its parent. Also used to connect some log aggregating asset with the sources of their logs. E.g. An AWS LOG GROUP asset can have an AWS RDS as its parent, indicating that that is the log group for that RDS.
	project = var.project	# Project separates different resources of multiple users and control access to specific resources

	# ### optional ### 
	# application = var.application	# The Asset ID of the application asset that \"owns\" the asset.
	# asset_source = var.asset_source	# The source platform/vendor/system of the asset data. Usually the service responsible for creating that asset document
	# audit_data_type = var.audit_data_type	# 
	# audit_pull_enabled = var.audit_pull_enabled	# If true, sonargateway will collect the audit logs for this system if it can.
	# audit_type = var.audit_type # Example Values: "LOGSTORE", "LOGSTORE_POSTGRESQL", "LOGSTORE_MYSQL"	# Used to indicate what mechanism should be used to fetch logs on systems supporting multiple ways to get logs, see asset specific documentation for details
	# consumer_group_workers = 2	# Only applies if pull_type is consumer_group. The number of consumers that will be part of the consumer group. For best performance this should match the number of shards in your logstore.
	# content_type = var.content_type	# Content type should be set to the desired <'parent' asset 'Server Type'>, which is the one that uses this asset as a destination for logs. NOTE: The content_type field will take precedence on the lookup for parent_asset_id field when checking which server is sending logs to this asset.
	# criticality = var.criticality # Example Values: "1", "2", "3", "4"	# The asset's importance to the business. These values are measured on a scale from \"Most critical\" (1) to \"Least critical\" (4). Allowed values: 1, 2, 3, 4
	# enable_audit_management = var.enable_audit_management	# If true, Sonar is responsible for setting and updating the policies
	# enable_audit_monitoring = var.enable_audit_monitoring	# If true, Sonar sends emails/alerts when the audit policies change.
	# entitlement_enabled = var.entitlement_enabled	# If true, Entitlement Management system is enabled.
	# jsonar_uid = var.jsonar_uid	# Unique identifier (UID) attached to the Sonar machine controlling the asset
	# managed_by = var.managed_by	# Email of the person who maintains the asset; can be different from the owner specified in the owned_by field. Defaults to admin_email.
	# owned_by = var.owned_by	# Email of Owner / person responsible for the asset; can be different from the person in the managed_by field. Defaults to admin_email.
	# pull_type = "log_client" # Example Values: "log_client", "consumer_group"	# The method used to pull data from the logstore.
	# region = var.region	# For cloud systems with regions, the default region or region used with this asset
	# sdm_enabled = var.sdm_enabled	# Sensitive data management (SDM) is enabled if this parameter is set to True.
	# server_port = "443"	# 
	# used_for = var.used_for # Example Values: "Production", "Test", "Development", "Demonstration", "QA", "Staging", "Training", "Disaster Recovery"	# Designates how this asset is used / the environment that the asset is supporting.
	asset_connection {
		auth_mechanism = "default"
		# ### required ### 
		reason = null # Example Values: "default", "ad-hoc-query" # reason description: "What this connection is used for. Used to differentiate connections if multiple connections exist for this asset"
		# ### optional ### 
		# amazon_secret = null # amazon_secret description: "Configuration to integrate with AWS Secrets Manager"
		# cyberark_secret = null # cyberark_secret description: "Configuration to integrate with CyberArk Vault"
		# hashicorp_secret = null # hashicorp_secret description: "Configuration to integrate with HashiCorp Vault"
